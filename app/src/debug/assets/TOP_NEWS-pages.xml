                <item key="summary">A mountain of debt built up by Chinese investors eager to cash in on the soaring stock market crumbled on Monday, sending the stock market down 7.7%, its worst day in six years. The collapse came after Chinese regulators disciplined three major brokers for violating rules on margin lending that helped fuel China’s historic stock market rally, with shares up 53% last year. Figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show that the amount of margin trading in China is among the highest in the world, and is already up 9% in 2015, putting the balance at 1.1 trillion yuan ($177 billion) as of Friday. China has been building up debt rapidly since the financial crisis, as local governments have</item>

                <item key="summary">Oil prices started the week deep in negative territory on expectations that a sustained recovery is still a long way off. U.S. crude snapped a seven-week losing streak last week after bullish comments by an international energy watchdog. But analysts said they see little evidence that the combination of oversupply and sluggish demand that has pummeled prices since last summer is abating. Brent crude for March delivery fell 2.2% to about $49 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in February traded at $47.56 a barrel in recent trade, down 2.3% from Friday’s settlement. Over the weekend, J.P.

                <item key="summary">The Swiss franc remained pinned at sky-high levels on Monday, hovering around one-to-one against the euro after last week’s shock decision by the Swiss National Bank to allow its currency to climb freely. The franc has now gained almost 20% against the euro since last week. After the SNB’s announcement Thursday, the euro lost about 30% in value against the franc—the biggest single-day move in a developed market that traders could recall. Beat Siegenthaler, a currency strategist at UBS, said Monday that around parity, the Swiss franc “appears more overvalued versus the euro than at any other time in the last 30 years,” and is likely to put “significant strain” on the country’s economy.</item>

According to shipbrokers and analysts, the 3-million-barrel megaship—one of the largest in the world—is just one example of a growing trend that sees traders seeking ways to turn a profit in the slumping global oil market. The strategy is simple: buy and store oil at cheap prices now and sell futures contracts to lock in the higher oil prices expected later. “It is one of the easy ways to make money and that’s one of the interesting things about it from</item>

                <item key="summary">A White House tax plan released over the weekend promises to rekindle a long-simmering debate over how to use the tax code to close income gaps between the wealthy and the middle class. At a minimum, the plan represents President Barack Obama’s opening bid to congressional Republicans in a potential negotiation over a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, including the rules for individual taxpayers. Sharply negative reactions from GOP lawmakers suggested it is unlikely that many of Mr. Obama’s ideas would become law in the current GOP-run Congress. In political terms, the plan appeared aimed at helping Mr. Obama cement a legacy as an economic populist, and could even help Democratic</item>

Nationalbank cut its deposit rate to minus 0.2% from minus 0.05%, and its lending rate to 0.05% from 0.2%. The krone has strengthened against the euro after a rate cut by the Swiss central bank last week. The Danish central bank is counting on the rate reduction to weaken the attractiveness of Danish currency denominated assets to investors seeking other triple-A rated places in Europe to place their money.

Now BP is facing up to $13.7 billion in federal fines—about $10 billion more than it has set aside—in much less comfortable economic circumstances now that oil prices have plunged. The company is set to go to trial Jan. 20 in federal court in New Orleans over how much it must pay the U.S. government for each barrel of crude that spilled into the Gulf, in the final phase of litigation stemming from violations of the Clean Water Act.

He hid in a bus headed to this U.S. military base, sneaked past a police checkpoint, then pleaded with the American sentry: “Hey, buddy, I’m running away. Open the gate.” Mr. Baudin has been here ever since, part of a small group of Cuban exiles who, in a hot moment of the Cold War, won permission from the U.S. government to stay at the Guantanamo Bay Naval base until Cuba was free.
